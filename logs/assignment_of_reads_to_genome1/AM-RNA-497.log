Allele-tagging report
=====================
Processed 5206 read alignments in total
Reads were unaligned and hence skipped: 0 (0.00%)
4192 reads were unassignable (80.52%)
637 reads were specific for genome 1 (12.24%)
353 reads were specific for genome 2 (6.78%)
11 reads did not contain one of the expected bases at known SNP positions (0.21%)
24 contained conflicting allele-specific SNPs (0.46%)


SNP coverage report
===================
SNP annotation file:	/project/bioinf_meissner/src/SNPsplit/SNPsplit_v0.3.2/all_SNPs_CAST_EiJ_GRCm38.txt.gz
SNPs stored in total:	20668547
N-containing reads:	1025
non-N:			4181
total:			5206
Reads had a deletion of the N-masked position (and were thus called Conflicting):	0 (0.00%)
Of which had multiple deletions of N-masked positions within the same read:	0 (0.00%)

Of valid N containing reads,
N was present in the list of known SNPs:	1290 (100.00%)
N was not present in the list of SNPs:		0 (0.00%)
