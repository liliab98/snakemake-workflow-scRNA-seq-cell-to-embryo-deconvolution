Allele-tagging report
=====================
Processed 5273 read alignments in total
Reads were unaligned and hence skipped: 0 (0.00%)
4278 reads were unassignable (81.13%)
615 reads were specific for genome 1 (11.66%)
359 reads were specific for genome 2 (6.81%)
11 reads did not contain one of the expected bases at known SNP positions (0.21%)
21 contained conflicting allele-specific SNPs (0.40%)


SNP coverage report
===================
SNP annotation file:	/project/bioinf_meissner/src/SNPsplit/SNPsplit_v0.3.2/all_SNPs_CAST_EiJ_GRCm38.txt.gz
SNPs stored in total:	20668547
N-containing reads:	1004
non-N:			4267
total:			5273
Reads had a deletion of the N-masked position (and were thus called Conflicting):	2 (0.04%)
Of which had multiple deletions of N-masked positions within the same read:	0 (0.00%)

Of valid N containing reads,
N was present in the list of known SNPs:	1314 (99.92%)
N was not present in the list of SNPs:		1 (0.08%)
